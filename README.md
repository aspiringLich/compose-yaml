# compose-yaml

I love the compose key but I hate the format of the .XCompose file so I bodged together a really shitty couple of scripts to generate a .XCompose file. Keysym definitions are in `keysym.yaml`, `compose.py` generates the .XCompose file, and `generate-typst.py` generates a yaml file with all the math symbols from [typst](https://typst.app/docs/reference/symbols/sym/) because I felt like it.

Greatest technical achievement of my life.
